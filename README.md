# Traffic Simulation in C++

This project simulates traffic flow in a city using a C++ implementation. The simulation includes various components such as traffic lights, vehicles, and road intersections, aiming to model real-world traffic dynamics and provide insights into traffic management strategies.

## Features

- **Traffic Light System**: Simulates traffic lights with varying cycles (red, yellow, green).
- **Vehicle Movement**: Simulates vehicles moving through intersections, obeying traffic signals.
- **Road Network**: Models a network of roads with multiple intersections.
- **Real-time Simulation**: The simulation runs in real-time, showing vehicles moving across the road network.
- **Statistics**: Collects and displays performance data, such as vehicle travel time, congestion levels, and light cycle durations.

## Requirements

- **C++ Compiler** (C++11 or higher recommended)
- **CMake** (for building the project)

## Installation

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/traffic-simulation.git
cd traffic-simulation
